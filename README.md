# Mapping_Earthquakes

To illustrate the severity of the earthquakes in relation to the tectonic plates, you’ll need to log in to GitHub and access the tectonic plate data from this GitHub repository. (Links to an external site.) You will also need to make an API call to the tectonic plate data using d3.json(), and then add the data as an overlay to the map using the L.geoJSON() layer. In addition to the streets and satelliteStreets maps, you’ll need to add a third map style of your choosing. All map styles must be added to the base layer so that they show up on the map to allow the user to change which layers are visible.
